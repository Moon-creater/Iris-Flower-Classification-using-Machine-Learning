This project implements a machine learning classification model to predict the species of an iris flower based on its sepal and petal measurements. The dataset consists of 150 samples across three species:

Iris Setosa

Iris Versicolor

Iris Virginica

The goal is to build a supervised classification model that accurately identifies the species using numerical feature data.

📊 Dataset Information

The dataset contains the following features:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

Species (Target Variable)

The dataset contains no missing values and requires minimal preprocessing.
